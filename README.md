# Leveraging LLMs for Multilingual MFT values
This is a repo for LLMs measuring moral foundation values in multilingual contexts. It is the blueprint for the research project of the my thesis. 

General Goals: 
1. practice my coding skills in Python to train LLMs for specific tasks
2. finish a NLP paper for my thesis, which is a methodology chapter
3. practice project management skills
4. practice team working skills
5. practice experiment research design methods

__Anchor literature__: [Data-Efficient Strategies for Expanding Hate Speech Detection into Under-Resourced Languages](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.383.pdf). Follow the research design of this paper to design the research project.
